## The idea

The final goal is to replace the commercial systems that provide what we need to live and thrive with trade-free organizations and networks so everyone can access goods and services without buying or trading for them.  This is done with three general actions. 
1. Educating the public and promoting sharing and generosity. 
2. Showing people the networks, tools and methods that facilitate, permit and organize sharing and generosity. We call them Free Collaboration Networks.
3. Telling people about this project, and giving it visibility, and people how it these actions are done so that more and more people participate.
