## The idea

The idea of this site is to provide a simple yet effective method of materializing the values and goals of the New Human Rights Movement. 
The method, called Prosocializing, or the DIY Transition Plan, 

enables us individuals to build the RBE Shared World of trade-free abundance in a decentralized fashion, step by step, 
in the communities we live in. It also provides a list of Free Collaboration Networks, 
which we are to use and expand into an ecosystem that will replace businesses and corporations as our supply of goods and services.
