## The idea

The goal of this application is to slowly create a complete Natural Law / Resource Based Economy resource management software for education and maybe practical use.

<!--more-->

The present data model supports locations, unlimited number of parameters to describe every resource, multiple quantities for every resource and transformations of resources with arbitrary recursive dependency resolving.

However only a few of these functions are available at the moment and have to be done manually like the ability to record resources and their transformations into other resources. Next step is to have fully automated order resolution based on resource dependencies and distance
