## The idea

Bots are used to update news and handle discord roles.

<!--more-->

## The project

New bot created in Python. Handles roles and info [https://github.com/TZMCommunity/TZMBot](https://github.com/TZMCommunity/TZMBot)

The old bot that handles updating news site [https://github.com/tzmfi/discord-bot](https://github.com/tzmfi/discord-bot)

### Help needed

Functionality of the old bot should be moved to the new one (and possibly rethink how updates are done to news site).

### Activity

Update 2020-03-06: Updated 2019. In active use.
