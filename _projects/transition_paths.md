## The idea

A growing number of people seem to agree that this current system isn't working towards healthy planet and humanity.

It also looks like people aren't finding the solutions to that problem that they could join to take part in.

This app is here to help you find your path towards a more sustainable future. Take small steps and see where the path takes you.

I hope our paths cross sooner or later :)
