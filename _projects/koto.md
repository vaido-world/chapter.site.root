### Units

Purpose of Koto Coop is development of technologies and social structures that makes sustainable, 
post-scarcity society possible and making this development feasible. 
To advance this development we aim at creating operational models, 
which lets us succeed in getting people involved and providing them livelihood. 
This way we strive at sustainably supporting development and research.

#### Communities
Community type of unit are where members can live ecologically without barter, 
improve their skills and plans which help expand the way of living and gather resources needed to set up a next unit. 
Number of units will grow exponentially and money needed for the next unit decrease 
because resources will be produced more and more inside co-op.
