## The idea
Originally started by Finnish branch, Koto Coop -project is an effort to start an Co-op and network of intentional communities.

<!--more-->

We will start an co-op that will fund and set up different types of “units” to help activist have more freedom to work on projects.

### Communities
Community type of unit are where members can live ecologically without barter, improve their skills and plans which help expand the way of living and gather resources needed to set up a next unit. 
Number of units will grow exponentially and money needed for the next unit decrease because resources will be produced more and more inside co-op.

Participation share will grant you right to live in any of the units and move to another unit at will. Price of the share is so equals to price of the resources needed to build one apartment. Monthly cost will be less than what people typically pay rent.

### Other types
For example a group of people living in a city, working together to gather resources for the co-op, taking care of a comunity garden and getting resources from co-op like for example food products.
