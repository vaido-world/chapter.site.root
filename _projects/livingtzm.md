## The idea

Welcome to the Living TZM channel where people living and exploring the exciting ways of The Zeitgeist Movement showcase their activities, opinions and lifestyle.
    
Send us your media creations via e-mail. Our editors will assist with logos and graphics, arrangement, and general suggestions which will be sent back to you for approval prior to being published. Please upload the content to service you like to use and send us links to living@tzm.community.
