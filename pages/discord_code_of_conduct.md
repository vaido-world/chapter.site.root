## **DEAR FELLOW CITIZEN OF THE WORLD**

Your  participation and everyone else’s is required to be a part of the world’s largest social change ever commenced in history. It is the goal of this movement to bring light to a new perspective, a new train of thought as well as bringing the best knowledge of living more sustainably and in harmony with each other and the rest of nature.
By participating in this movement, you are being involved in social assemblies, scientific and technological research and practices, local and global community efforts, charity operations, environmental rescue and even personal development.
Each of us is personally responsible for supporting our core values, which require compliance with an ethical conduct. We have issued this Code of Conduct to restate our longstanding commitment to uphold that responsibility and to provide guidance to your and everyone’s participation in the movement.
As we move forward, The Zeitgeist Movement will help ensure that the message of a more sustainable, collaborative and inclusive coherence in society is made heard. A commitment to integrity, acting honestly and ethically, and complying with the law are critical to our continued success.

Thank you for your participation.

## **SHORT SUMMARY**

**1. Please treat everyone with respect.**

> Insulting, derogatory and/or any other disrespectful discourse is inappropriate and unacceptable. 

**2. Please do not engage in personal attacks/Ad Hominem.**

> An Ad Hominem is arguing with and/or attacking the person instead of addressing the topic in case it is not about the person. Try not to respond to such attacks, except to politely expose the situation and redirect the discussion to the topic.
Threats are not allowed, whether towards individuals, groups or the community as a whole. Threats are disrespectful and utterly against the train of thought of TZM

**3. Respect the specific task of the activity.**

> Participate with the correct intentions for a certain project, task, assembly, content or anything in the movement. While the movement’s activity is inclusive for all, do not burden, distract, be disrespectful or problematic during that activity.

**4. Remember and uphold the Code of Conduct.**

> It is everyones and your responsibility to uphold and inform others participating within TZM our Code of Conduct to protect yourself, others and the integrity of TZM. It cannot be done alone and therefore everyone is required to do this.

**5. Make differences into strengths.**

> Instead on fixing all the things that you do not agree with another person, focus on resolving issues and learning from mistakes. Make the community larger. Collaboration instead of competition.

## **CODE OF ETHICS & COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT**

The Zeitgeist Movement (TZM) practices egalitarian, transparent and equal opportunities for anyone wishing to contribute to the movement. When persons claim association with TZM and commence activity with other persons in association, they must comply with the Code of Conduct as instructed in this document. The aim is to  interact  in a community environment in association with TZM that does not hamper a person’s education, health, safety, and mental or physical development. Failure to comply with this Code of Conduct, especially in a community environment or when explicily claiming association with TZM, may result in exclusion and denial of association with TZM as well as possible legal action if necessary.

## **HOW WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER**

Within TZM we treat each other with equal respect and dignity. This means that all persons are entitled to participate within the movement while in a community environment free of harassment, bullying and discrimination.
Harassment, bullying and discrimination take many forms, including: 
* Unwelcome remarks, gestures or physical contact 
* The display or circulation of offensive, derogatory or sexually explicit pictures or other materials
* Offensive or derogatory jokes or comments (explicit or by innuendo) 
* Verbal or physical abuse or threats
* Venting anger or frustration onto others

This movement is non-hierarchical and rejects any proposed solutions employing the use of violence or coercion.This is in order to obtain peace and harmony. If anybody claims the opposite of this statement while claiming association with TZM, they will be denied any association.

## **BEING INCLUSIVE**

We welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to persons of any sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, social and economic class, educational level, color, immigration status, sex, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability are welcome to contribute to the movement.
There is no membership, tuition fee, academic background, specific credentials, pledge or anything aside from agreeing with this Code of Conduct required to participate.
It is TZM’s strongest intention to protect the integrity, reputation and safety of all persons associated with the movement as well its own.

Everyone is coming from a different background, different challenges and different stories. We understand that people are capable of saying and doing things that are not intended. Despite these mistakes, we always understand to include them as part of a larger process. If you or any person is not capable of upholding TZM’s Code of Conduct at any given time, it is suggested to take a break and come back at a more convenient time to participate. If your completely unable to act within the Code of Conduct It is recommend you disassociate from the movement.

## **DIVERSITY**

We can find strength in diversity. Different people have different perspectives on issues, and that can be valuable for solving problems or generating new ideas. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that we all make mistakes, and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere.
Instead, focus on resolving issues, learning from mistakes and understanding new points of view.

## **COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT**

Any meeting location, community center, event, project space, website or other media, social media, instant messaging groups and any task of activism that is associated with TZM are defined as a community environment within the movement. All community environments associated with TZM are expected to comply to the standard of the movement’s Code of Conduct. It is also recommended that a copy of the Code of Conduct  is  made available for all to see within the community environments.

If any community environment fails to fulfill the standards of the Code of Conduct and countermeasures are not being taken then the community environment is to be aborted and will have no further association to TZM.
