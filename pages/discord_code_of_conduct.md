title: TZM Discrod Code of conduct

This is a general policy regarding how to deal with people who repeatedly violate the TZM Discord code of conduct.

Created: 10th May 2019

1. We have a general policy of appropriate but escalating response. Which is to say that if someone causes trouble then we can take appropriate action. Posting a response to the person with a warning. The person gets two warnings. You post a copy of the warning to this #admin-channel on the 3rd time the person is muted. You let them know via PM, and post a message to #arguments or maybe #thevoid if it's expected to be temporary.
The mute can be for a variable length of time, e.g 24hrs, 3 days or a week.

If the person continues to violate the server guidelines after returning then they are given just one warning then on the 2nd time they are muted and blinded this time for at least double the time before.

If they violate the rules again in obviously destructive ways then they are muted-and-blinded a 3rd time and a meeting can be held to work out how long it should be. Most likely 1-6 months.

Anything after that is a ban.
There is however a cooldown effect. Should the person be going through some bad issues at the time and they've since recovered and are being helpful and/or productive members of the community then over time the escalation point can be relaxed. e.g If the next violation would cause a 6 month ban then it might be they get another warning and only a 1 week ban. Eventually being reset back to zero.
As an example, there was some problems between Actrons and Mark Enoch in the Telegram chat group back in the day. But now I don't see any issues (although I think it's mostly because they aren't in the same groups anymore but also because both have moved on).

The above is just a general suggestion. SpamBots, people posting child-porn or being extra destructive can be insta-banned.

2. The people doing the actual muting/banning should, if possible not be involved in the discussion / attacks. This is designed to stop any single person becoming perceived as overbearing or abusing their power and reduces the chances of emotional backlashes from admins causing more problems. By bringing someone else in to review the situation it's not just the same person dealing with it. The main point is to be fair and impartial.

Note that we need to have clear guidelines in the rules about warning people and then muting them and the consequences of repeated problems.
The people being muted or causing issues also have a right to know what they are doing wrong and hence the warnings and messages about what is happening and why.
Communication is key.

3. Please note that the actions you take on people have a massive effect on the community. How things are conducted can help rally or worry the community. So consider not just the individual user but also the community.
Actually a full 4 quadrants review should be done if possible http://www.integralhealthresources.com/integral-health-2/the-four-quadrants/
Individual, Collective, Interior, Exterior


If you are worried about what exactly to send them, then you could derive something appropriate from the example response below:

    Hi <users name>,

    You've been muted on this server for repeatedly violating the community guidelines. You've been given multiple warnings and are now only able to discuss in  the #thevoid channel.

    This will last for the next <insert time hours/days/weeks/months> after which we will return your status back unless you continue to violate the guidelines.


    Specifically you have violated <insert previous warnings and latest issue>


    We hope that in the mean time you reflect on the type of influence you would like to be in the community and how we can all work better together.




For reference the Rules of Conduct

    1. Please treat everyone with respect.

    Insulting, derogatory and/or any other disrespectful discourse is inappropriate and unacceptable. 


    2. Please do not engage in personal attacks/Ad Hominem.

    An Ad Hominem is arguing with and/or attacking the person instead of addressing the topic in case it is not about the person. Try not to respond to such attacks, except to politely expose the situation and redirect the discussion to the topic. 

    Threats are not allowed, whether towards individuals, groups or the community as a whole. Threats are disrespectful and utterly against the train of thought of TZM. Making threats may result in a ban.


    3. Respect the specific category/channel designations within Discord.

    This includes their descriptions, including the discussion going on at the moment. If you cannot find an appropriate channel for something and you feel that it relates to The Zeitgeist Movement, you can get in contact with a server administrators or ask around in the #off-topic or #international-discussion channels!


    Even though we allow more free off-topic discussion, this hub is still TZM relevant and therefore trolling will not be tolerated and comments that are too much off-topic will be deleted, if they are not written in the off-topic channel.


    4. Respect a Moderator's decision.

    To set a channel to be moderated, delete a channel, request users move a particular discussion to another channel and/or prohibit further discourse, by enforcing server kicks, global mutes or bans.


    5. Do not post an individual's contact information unless it is already publicly available.

    Or if you have been given explicit permission from the person to do so. Also, use discretion before posting your own contact information such as phone numbers. Private messaging is the best way to exchange personal info, if necessary.
