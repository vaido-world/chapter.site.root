This project represents - in gesture - some of the tenets of what has been termed a “Resource Based Economic Model”, as proposed by such organisations as The Venus Project, The Zeitgeist Movement, and several others. To familiarise yourself with the concept, we recommend reading the book “The New Human Rights Movement” by Peter Joseph, which is available from Amazon and other outlets. You can also watch the free online film “Zeitgeist: Moving Forward”, particularly “Part III: Project Earth”, upon which most of the lyrics of this track are based.
