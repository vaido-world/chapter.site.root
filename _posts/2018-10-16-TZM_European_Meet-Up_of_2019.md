### TZM European Meet-Up of 2019
#### jeukku (Juuso V)


Welcome to the third Zeitgeist European Meet-Up of 2019 in Enköping, Sweden!

What is the Zeitgeist European Meet-Up? This is an international gathering of members of the Zeitgeist Movement (TZM) or guests that are interested in TZM and that are located somewhere in Europe. The first European Meet-Up was held in Rotterdam, Netherlands in December of 2015. The second European Meet-Up took place in Kiev, Ukraine in July of 2017. Now, our third European Meet-Up is going to be held in Scandinavia, west of Stockholm and once again in the summertime, so that all of our guests may enjoy the beautiful weather and exceptionally long days that Sweden enjoys in the summer.

If you have any other questions, please send us an email, write us on Facebook or other social media platforms.

What happens during this event? This differs from, and is more comprehensive and personal than, other typical TZM events. Instead of only being overwhelmed by a bunch of presentations with lots of factual information, we are presenting a vacation-like event for people to have fun, socialize at, and enjoy. Keep in mind, as well, that this is going to be a very productive and idea-rich event, with many new insights regarding projects and developments happening within TZM. Numerous other like-minded people and organizations will also be attending this event.
