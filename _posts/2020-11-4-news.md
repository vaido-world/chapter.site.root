### Mark E. Prosocialize (Catalonia)

@â€‹everyone  
Weekly call to action:  
1. If you haven't already, read the progress reports of the latest Open Access Assembly here:  
https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/OiGp04fllCnu9imZ1B6LpsJiaWJ5C9orUqIvZ9oLe6s/  
  
2. Perform the group task asked for at the assembly, please like and share this video

Whatever we think up, it will take a lot of boring work to transition to the NLRBE, but "slow but steady wins the race" ðŸ’ª  Go Team TZM!
