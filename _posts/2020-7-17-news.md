### JuusoV (Finland)

TZM Matrix chat has been updated and is more userfriendly now. Few of the most important channels have been "bridged" to Discord. Which means messages are "forwarded" between matrix and Discord.   
If you are worried about the privacy issues on Discord, this chat is a great way of staying in touch with the community.  
There is also a a chat room that is encrypted. We can create more of such rooms if people are interested.

TZM Iceland is not the only branch to have a Z-Day this year. Earlier in Mongolia, the TZM branch there held a small local Z-Day despite the Covid pandemic problems. Only resulting in a few people showing up, they have never missed doing a single Z-Day ever! Respect!üëç üëç <:TZM_logo:616829207044947998>
