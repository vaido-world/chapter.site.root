### Mark E. Prosocialize (Catalonia)

@â€‹everyone   
**Call to meeting:**  
Merry Christmas, winter solstice, rebirth of the sun or whatever you call it!   
  
As every last Saturday of the month, this Saturday 26th at 9UTC here in discord we will meet at the Open Access Assembly in the (voice) International channel and in#int-voice-chat !  https://discord.gg/TtswKsh  
This is where you can share your progress and ask for help with your project.   
  
If you don't know what time that is for you, use this converter: http://www.timebie.com/std/index.php  
  
Here is the link to the pad where we will write the minutes:   
https://cloud.tzm.community/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/&openfile=6370  
In the "progress report" section  is where you should write down your progress raising awareness or in your transition project. If you can, do so before the meeting. Even if you cannot partake in the assembly, your report is still greatly appreciated.   
If there is something you wish to discuss or a project you wish to recruit people for, write it down in the "agenda" along with your name.   
  
The more the merrier so please get at least one other person to come too!  
(copy-paste this call on social media or to friends etc)  
  
Thank you all again, and you are extremely powerful and loved. Let's combine that energy for a better future.  
  
Love you and enjoy a shared world!
