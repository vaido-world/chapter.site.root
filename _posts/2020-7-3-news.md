### Mark advertise a shared world

@​everyone Today, we have democratically decided by those present, to change the name of the periodic global assemblies. In these assemblies,  everyone is welcome and invited to collectively write a report of our progresses and ask each other for help with our initiatives. From now on, until further change we will call them Open Access Assemblies.   
You can find all the past ones here: https://news.tzm.community/notes/
