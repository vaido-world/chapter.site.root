### Mark advertise the RBE

The Transition to the Commons is happening! Join it!   
https://buynothingproject.org/  has tens of thousands of localities, in twenty different countries, with active and growing Free Collaboration Networks, groups of people providing trade-free resources to each other. To go beyond Facebook (where the FCNs are currently organized), the founders of the Buy Nothing Project are creating a new app to facilitate organizing free access to resources. https://www.soop.app/  
  
Meanwhile it is becoming fashionable for public libraries in the USA to turn in to full fledged resource banks by offering all sorts of items to be borrowed 100% trade-free. From blue-ray players to bicycles and pressure washers, from guitars to microscopes and games. Just type in "library of things [your locality]" in your search engine.   
  
By raising awareness and expanding Free Collaboration Networks we are making it happen, now!   
Happy Gift Society!
