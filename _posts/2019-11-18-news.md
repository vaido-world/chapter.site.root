### Michael Kubler

Hello fellow RBE advocates, TZM members and anyone interested in a post-scarcity society,  
  
Myself and Wiri a fellow TZM member created a Podcast. We talked about the Price of Zero transition to an RBE and a whole lot of other interesting things.  
You don't have to watch the whole 2hr thing, but add it to your playlist :-)
