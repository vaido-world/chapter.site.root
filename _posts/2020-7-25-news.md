### Colin R. Turner

I read your article @Michael Kubler about re-invigorating the movement with interest. I would like to see more proliferation of practical ideas like Sharebay, KotoCoop and others rather than continually focusing on promotions/abstractions. I think there's a danger that, in the absence of real world application, TZM could find itself relegated to cult status with nothing to show except a figurehead, a bunch of ideas and a bunch of idea-believers. ðŸ˜‰
