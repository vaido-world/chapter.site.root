### Mark E. Prosocialize (Catalonia)

@â€‹everyone  
**Weekly call to action:**  
1. Please read the minutes (notes) of this last Wednesday's Open Access Assembly and add your own personal progress report to it. Whatever you have done to disseminate content that promotes a shared open access world, or to help the movement grow, is work worth reporting, no matter how small it may seem to you.  Here are the notes: https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/edit/wZFCD1qJga6SCrLcmJFHeGs-/  
(If you have issues opening the notes, tell us in #tzm-general )  
  
2. Please leave a nice comment under this video of the TZM transition project Koto Coop:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_UBsWDjYaw  
  
Thank you. Ideas - action = nothing.
