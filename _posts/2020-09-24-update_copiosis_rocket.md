### Help needed

We need help raising awareness about this project. Invitations to interviews would be fantastic. 
The directory of Free Collaboration Networks needs people to add to it the FCNs they know of or discover. 
We also are looking for volunteers willing to help the founder perform sporadic specific tasks as part of the 3 actions of the project.


### Update

Recent translation of the directory of Free Collaboration Networks created as a wiki. [https://openaccesseconomy.org/doku.php?id=free_collaboration_networks](https://openaccesseconomy.org/doku.php?id=free_collaboration_networks).
We were interview on a local television and are also now starting a test run of  a challenge to guide people into action.
