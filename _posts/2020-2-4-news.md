### Mark advertise a shared world

Once again we had very interesting and constructive monthly global assemblies. They included Gifter RBE commoners of 4 different continents and at least 8 different countries! Much progress is being made and we recommend that everyone reads the minutes (notes) of the meeting to stay informed and motivated (in the following link):

Among other things we decided to start using https://FreeWorlder.com as our contact network using the tag: "Zeitgeist Movement" . Please join it and add information about yourself that is relevant to the movement in the "Personal Signature" .    
  
We also have created the following Comm Card to share around the web to inform people how to stay connected as a global movement.  Please help us in this task.   
  
The Shift to the Commons is happening thanks to the efforts of all of you to keep raising awareness. Keep at it! We are a legion!
