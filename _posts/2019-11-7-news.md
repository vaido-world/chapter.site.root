Peter Joseph:  
Friends,  
  
This is step one of the process for those interested in attending the Los Angeles internal screening ("Internal" due to film festival issues) of InterReflections.  
  
Register with this form if you were not part of the Indiegogo crowdfunding effort (If you were, you are being contacted with priority soon or already)  
  
Once those who contributed are taken care of, tickets will be open, on a first come - first serve basis, extracted from the wait list.  
  
There will be a $30.00 standard ticket and a $75.00 supporter/"Vip" ticket which includes an opening reception with food/drink. Total time block for the event is 4:30pm to 11:30pm.  
  
Ahrya Fine Arts Cinema  
8556 Wilshire Boulevard  
Beverly Hills, CA 90211  
  
Thanks

p.s. Please don't complain about these prices or approach. This project has left me 6 figures in debt and zero marketing budget, which means I have to play a series of release games to recover.
