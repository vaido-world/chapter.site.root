@â€‹everyone we had another wonderful global progress assembly today. If you couldn't attend, check out the minutes. It is really exciting to see all the progress we are making, and please add your own little or big progress. There you will also see the projects we are presently working on and would love your participation in, just jump in. https://board.net/p/TZM_Global_meetings_October_2019  
  
If you didn't make it to this progress assembly, try to attend this coming Wednesday's one. (30.10. 21UTC). It will be held on a mumble server, we will provide the link to it here in this thread.  And invite others to it too!  
  
Together, by steadily raising awareness and incrementally providing access to free resources, we will make the shift to the Commons happen. That will produce Universal Sustainable Prosperity! We will make it! ðŸ’ª
