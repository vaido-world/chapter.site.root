### David Dann

Iâ€™ll be hosting the TZM International meeting next week.  
We invite all activists who want to touch base and share any progress they have made while setting objectives on how we can grow and be active as a movement. If there is something you would like to bring up during the meeting, please note it down in the etherpad. See you then ðŸ˜ƒ https://board.net/p/TZM_Global_TeamSpeak_Wednesday_29_May_2019
