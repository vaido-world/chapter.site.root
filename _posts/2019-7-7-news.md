### jeukku (Juuso V)

The European meeting continued with a few more people, sightseeing, more informal discussions and partying. I'm in awe how wise and loving these people are.  
  
We had good food, beautiful music and dance performances, impressive poems by @Lawrence  and very loving atmosphere ‚ù§  
  
This was my last day and sadly I had to leave early, but we had a very relaxing morning and a meditation session together.   
  
I want to thank two members of TVP from Norway who showed us that we really don't need to worry about being different organizations. We are all a big family.  
  
Of course this couldn't have happened without the amazing work of the people organizing the event. Much love to everyone involved. I feel like a changed man (or a bear :D)
