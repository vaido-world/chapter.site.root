### Mark advertise a shared world

Last month's global assemblies included over 10 people from at least 8 different countries! If you didn't attend, please read the progress reports in the minutes of the meeting linked below. Doing so is very motivating. Much new great content has been created and is ready to share to help promote a shared world.

Please share the progress reports with others to help inspire them to participate and get active. Also share this TZM COMM card with them so they know how to come to the next meetings. TZM is you, TZM is them, TZM is all of us and together we are unstoppable.
