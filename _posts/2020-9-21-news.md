### Mark E. Prosocialize (Catalonia)

@â€‹everyone Call to assembly!  
  
This coming Saturday 26th at 9UTC here in discord we will hold the Open Access Assembly in the (voice) International and #int-voice-chat !  https://discord.gg/TtswKsh  
This is where you can share your progress and ask for help with your project. This is the link to the pad where we will write the minutes:   
https://board.net/p/TZM_Global_Saturday26_September_2020  
In the "progress report" section  is where you should write down your progress raising awareness or in your project. If you can, do so before the meeting.  
If there is something you wish to discuss or a project you wish to recruit people for, write it down in the "agenda" along with your name.   
  
Remember: Ideas - action = nothing !   
  
The more the merrier so please get at least one other person to come too!  
(copy-paste this call on social media or to friends etc)  
Together we ARE building the RBE shared world!
