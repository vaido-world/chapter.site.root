Branches from Sweden and Finland are going on a cruise together and anyone interested is free to join!   
  
The cruise will leave from Helsinki, Finland at 16.4.2020 and people from Sweden will board on 17.4. (Viking Line, M/S Gabriella)  
  
In addition to cruise we will spend half a day together in Stockholm (17.4.) and in Helsinki (18.4.). So if you cannot join the cruise, you have the chance to meet people anyway!
