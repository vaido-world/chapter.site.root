### JuusoV (not a leader)

I copied the content from news.tzm.community to tzm.community site. All the new posts will be posted there like these automatic posts from this channel. Reports gathered from our experimental nextcloud instance and archived meeting notes.   
The old site still works, but links should be updated.
