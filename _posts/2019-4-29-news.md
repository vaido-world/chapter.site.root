### Mark advertise the RBE

The global monthly Saturday meeting on discord at 9UTC went great.   
SUMMARY  
=============================================  
We agreed that one of the main focuses of TZM is content creation. We will encourage people to do so by facilitating their work in #tzm_media_projects  and also appreciating their work by helping to disseminate it.   
The Website project is underway but slow and needs some help with people reviewing the existing content.  
The next TZM Newsletter is lower priority than working on the website. There's nothing time critical to promote right now.

Next Global Discord Saturday meeting will the 25th at 9UTC as always. Remember that attending at least one of the monthly New Human Rights Movement meetings is fundamental to stay communicated despite our parallel activities and to motivate each other and others to get and stay active. Everyone is welcome and please invite others  to come (by copy-pasting this message) for the movement to grow.   
If you wish to discuss something please add it to the agenda

The first global meeting in Spanish was a great success and motivating for all. We plan to continue holding them the last Saturday of every month, for now at 18UTC. Both new and old TZM proactivists attended. The Comm Protocol was introduced. I translated it to Spanish, along with the other relevant docs. https://board.net/p/Protocolo_de_Comunicacion_NMDH_(MZ)
