	<br>This pad will be transfered to the Trello

	<br>
	<br>Everybody is welcome to add to the agenda
	<br>

	<br>Mark
	<br>
	<br>Summary:
	<br>Worked on note keeping.&nbsp;
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>Tasks:&nbsp;
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeremy will create the facebook event
	and notepad for the next saturday meeting.&nbsp;
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>Progress Reports:
	<br>
	<br>I have been giving micro speeches at the Rotary meetings about
	the Gift Economy. We have a thing called &quot;happy dollar&quot; where
	we can stand up and say something for a dollar (to charity), I put in
	10$ and speek for a couple minutes about the Gift Economy.&nbsp;
	It&#x27;s causing a little bit of a confusion but some people are
	really liking it.&nbsp;
	<br>I have been handing out Gift Economy dvds and books to
	strangers and friends All carry Gift Economy logos and messages and the
	instructions to pass them on after being read&#x2F;watched and a link
	to the TZM discord server.&nbsp;
	<br>I went to &quot;coffee with candidates&quot; to the State
	House and State Senate. I gave them both a copy of The New Human Rights
	Movement and Moving Forward, asked them to promote and facilitate Free
	Collaboration Networks and understand and spread the 3 facts that are
	crucial: 1. The Common Good is bad for business because it eliminates
	markets. 2. There is plenty for every one. (60B$ would end world
	poverty but 1T$ was lost by the pentagon this year) 3. Collaboration is
	how we grow and evolve (our bodies are a colony of
	microorganisms).&nbsp;
	<br>I also gave other people at the event a copy of Moving
	Forward. They all were very interested in it.&nbsp;
	<br>I have been working on 2 guitar songs about the Gift
	Economy.&nbsp;
	<br>
	<br>I made&nbsp; a document to state possible applications of
	Discord bots (that use Discord&#x27;s extensive API) here:
	<br>

	<br>(I also spoke to some people about the concept of an RBE
	although ii don&#x27;t know much myself.)

	<br>
	<ul class="indent">
		<li>I&#x27;ve working on #tzm_developers and system where it
			could be easy to publish new chapter websites (and other TZM related
			websites too). Here is a template <a
			href="http&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;template&#x2e;tzm&#x2e;community&#x2F;">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;template.tzm.community&#x2F;</a>
			and Github link <a

	</ul>
	Chapter report:
	<br>
	<ul class="indent">
		<li>- Finland chapter has had long meetings about which direction
			we want to take the chapter. We are joining some events in the
			following months and had a live meeting with the core members (Sauna
			and staying up late discussing things :) ).&nbsp;</li>
		<li>- RBE Edu project is our current main project.</li>
		<li>- We started a non-profit organization called
			&quot;Post-Scarcity Support&quot; to take donations to for example
			host events and buy materials.</li>
		<li>- We published and email list. It is mostly people whose
			addresses we gathered at a festival.
	</ul>
	<br>Almost a month ago I started a moneyless Copiosis group using
	my own software written in Rust. We already have more than 50
	transaction among 15 people (5 active). Some people don&#x27;t even
	know they are involved.
	<br>Recently facebook started censoring our posts which appear a
	day later so we are trying to install our own social network Diaspora
	and Peertube instead of using youtube.
	<br>
	<br>Been debating online with libertarians about the cons of the
	free market they suggest.&nbsp; IRL performed an engine swap on a
	riding mower for better fuel economy, did extensive research for a
	bioDiesel swap for a 3rd gen F body rideshare project.

	<br>MarK RBE Enoch a.k.a advertisetheRBE
	<br>I have been full time RBEr in Spain and Catalonia for 4 years.
	One could call me the Spanish chapter coordinator. I am in multiple RBE
	phone chat groups. Please join them or check out my work in the
	following pages. I am calling on all RBErs to start a trend of
	advertising the RBE as often as they can with list that can be found in
	the article &quot;creating a resource based economy&quot; and posting
	about your advertising in the social media with the hashtag
	#advertisetheRBE

	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeremy Blankenship (MidnightMechanic)&nbsp;
	<br>I&#x27;ve been involved in the RBE community for 4, going on 5
	years, recently got involved with Copiosis and been helping Perry
	Gruber with advertizing through business cards and setting up
	conference call meetings every so often when necessary.&nbsp; For now,
	I&#x27;ve been working on a nomadic 3rd gen Camaro with a planned
	biohydroen Diesel install sometime in the near future, with step by
	step videos on my Youtube channel on how to build a converted car over
	to Diesel for cheap, especially for GM platforms.&nbsp; Currently in
	video production on how to fix car problems on the cheap, trying to
	expand my channel to different genres.&nbsp; Planning on using the car
	for ridesharing purposes. Based out in the country, not too far from
	Amanda, Ohio.

	<br>&nbsp; Charlie (CHATALOT1):
	<br>i&#x27;m really brand new to TZM and the concept of an RBE in
	general. i spend most of my time on discord and know an absurd amount
	about it but that&#x27;s&nbsp; pretty much my only use (i&#x27;m also
	learning about creating discord bots which can really benefit the TZM
	discord server (
	<a

	)&nbsp;
	<br>I&#x27;m learning python 3 and C# within unity&#x27;s API
	<br>About me personally:
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x27;m autistic
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i basically spend my entire life on Discord
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i&#x27;m somewhat depressed and commonly
	have mental breakdowns
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; best way to contact me is on discord
	(currently my name and discrim is CHATALOT1 (Floppy Bob)#0707
	<br>
	<br>&nbsp;Sava&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<br>&nbsp;I first discovered the RBE in 2013 when I stumbled upon
	&#8216;Paradise or Oblivion&#8217;, the Venus Project documentary. I
	had watched the first Zeitgeist documentary but didn&#8217;t come to
	the RBE part otherwise I would have known about it earlier. Ever since,
	I&#8217;ve wanted to take part in the RBE movements and I have
	registered for Money Free Party in April of 2018. My skillset is
	limited, I dropped out of University in 2016 and have been trying to
	learn programming for applications in the RBE. I am attempting to write
	a book about the RBE which will feature economic formulas that can be
	applied to the theory as well as RBE computer systems. I am not doing a
	lot of advertising but I occasionally bring up the RBE with my parents
	when we discuss politics. Most of the responses I get are negative; the
	RBE is seen as &#8216;Utopian&#8217;. I am currently learning Python,
	the programming language. I am also interested in starting a political
	country in my home country.
