* Sean: I have recorded 3 new songs in the last couple weeks and I am over half way through the next release. I can share a song if You'd like. \
  I have starting volunteering at a food rescue place for super markets and then delivers it to community centers. \
  I have been held a interreflections movie viewing on a projector and had about 10 people watching it. It provoked a lot of thought and also I am noticing a shift in the outlook of The Train Of Thought from "never happen" or "crazy" to "this makes sense" and "this is on to it". Mixed reactions is general. \\
* Mark Enoch: I have distributed a hundred TZMSustainableChristmas pamphlets. I have written to to 10 resource bank libraries in the US to ask them advice on how to turn my local library in to one. I also am writing a guide to prosocializing our municipality. The purpose is that with it anyone can get their city/town to regularly use Sharebay.org. It can easily be used to expand other FCNs. I always say "enjoy a shared world" instead of "bye".
* Kryptuskamo [Cesar]: I am working on getting certified as a Linux administrator and gain the knowledge needed to build open source tools for the world.
