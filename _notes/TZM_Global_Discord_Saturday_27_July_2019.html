The ideas of Universal Basic Access or Universal Basic Assets and free abundance to all by applying technology to benefit humans is becoming more mainstream (check out the podcast TeamHuman). Free Collaboration Networks are going viral.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Mark: I spoke up at a science talk about how oceanography can tackle global warming. I mentioned the need to escape market pressure in order to apply the changes we know are possible.&nbsp;<br>I did 2 Wake-Up-Call Day speeches. I have stamped over 400 bills with a comment agains the monetary dictatorship and a link to changingtheworldiseasy.com .&nbsp; I mentioned our work to different people at different occasions. I said &quot;Happy Gift Society&quot; instead of bye to many people, friends and strangers. I have done the C hand sign in many photos. I even did it in a white water rafting adventure video that many will see and some will keep and share with friends. I wrote a NHRM message and the TZM logo in very big on the rear window of a friend&#x27;s car.<br><br>Juuso:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our chapter had a summer meetup and five people attended. We were just hanging out in a park in Helsinki. Some new perspective and once again it turned out that people want to talk about more concrete things to do like ecovillages and building technology. We took a small brake and skipped a&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x27;ve been working on Koto and various things on Discord.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an idea about creating a &quot;future builders forum&quot; where different groups of people could join together. Tinyhome builders, localized energy builders, permaculture people for example. It would be a gathering of people, presentantaions and discussions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Living TZM&quot; idea is beginning to start. It is an idea of a LBRY&#x2F;Youtube&#x2F;whatever channel where the community can post whatever content they want to. It would make the movement look more human if people post updates on what they have been doing, opinions on different topics and&#x2F;or maybe songs for example <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;board&#x2e;net&#x2F;p&#x2F;TZM&#x5f;living&#x5f;introduction" rel="noreferrer noopener">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;board.net&#x2F;p&#x2F;TZM_living_introduction</a> . Project will be handled on Discord #tzm_community_content channel<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been experimenting with matrix.org&#x2F;riot.im and connecting discord&#x2F;riot&#x2F;telegram with &quot;bridges&quot;<br><br>Enid:<br>In the UK there is continued work on the national website.&nbsp; I worked through some old email accounts to sift out the legitimate emails from the spam.&nbsp; Now working on creating contact lists to see if people would still be interested in getting involved in TZM somehow.<br>I have an interest in thinking about better orientation to the ideas if the movement.<br>In terms of spreading the message I am interested in promoting more sustainable ways in terms of resource use.&nbsp; I leave messages at interactive art installations rather than leaflets in random places.&nbsp; Last year I wrote on a slate tile for the Truro Cathedral roof.<br>We also have a book group in the London Chapter which is currently going through The New Human Rights Movement.<br>David Dann put a message and Discord link on all the UK Facebook groups&#x2F;pages.<br><br>Michael K:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was planning on working on the Chapters part of thezeitgeistmovement.com website, however ended up with a combined cold and stomach bug which I&#x27;ve only just recovered from. I&#x27;ve been working with Ziad from the Common Heritage group who is interested in starting a web platform. Also Mario and myself are working on ideas for a TZM video series.<br><br>Woody:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been working on keeping the Discord server active by being present in the voice chat and moderating&#x2F;mediating issues that sometimes occur between people.<br>Work on the UK website is still on going, I work on it as and when I have time. I have been running performance tests on different themes to work out which one would be best to use for the website. I am concerned about keeping load times down as much as possible.<br>Enid has helped me by deleting a lot of spam that was in the inboxes of the email accounts on the server. She has also started putting together a list of emails which we can contact to see if people would want to get involved in TZM again, these emails are being collected from the non-spam emails on the old accounts.<br><br>Alt-Universe&nbsp;<br>Invited a friend called prism to TZM discord. Invited friends on a team I am on called the cream team to come to TZM discord. Explained&#x2F;discussed my thoughts on my youtube channel about TZM to people invovled on a reddit called IP2. Contemplating a plan of attack on how to revise TZM define.<br><br>Lawrence <strong>EU Meetup</strong><br>17 people at the EU Meetup. 15 for the entire week. Went to viking runes, outdoor museum, even burial mounds. Spent half the time indoors, half outdoors. Lots of fellowship and connection for the week. Exhausting but invigorating. Lots of great discussions and ideas.<br>Discussed various aspects of the movement looking at practical areas, agriculture, cultre, religion, where they have a place. Poetry, music.&nbsp;<br><br>Michal Mauser: We investigated a possible method of tenter which tries to avoid incompetent opinions by letting the problem solvers to vote among themselves. We however found serious problems with this making it unsuable. Our proposed fix was rejected.<br><br>Ragnar S&#228;de:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been trying to help people with science literacy and critical thinking in TZM Discord. I&#x27;ve been active in this Discord for only a few days, so still trying to get a hang on what this new wave of TZM is about, how it differs from the previous wave, and how much it aligns with my current thinking.<br><br>Neutral:<br>&nbsp; *Removed by editor, privacy matter*<br><strong>GENERAL NOTES </strong>(minutes)<br>=====================================================================================================<br><br><strong>Mark and Nora did the first Wake-Up-Call Day </strong>- Every now and then you tell everyone about it.
