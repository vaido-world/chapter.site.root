* Mark Enoch: I have distributed a few hundred more TZMSustainableChristmas pamphlets. I have been sharing chain messages to spark the transition on many comments sections of youtube videos. I still say: "Enjoy a shared world" instead of "bye" to almost everyone. I have friends that are sharing the TZMSustainableChristmas digital pamphlet with groups and friends. A friend has agreed to help me with the TZMSustainable Christmas stand. I am 2/3 finished with the guide to prosocializing: how to single handedly get a whole municipality to use sharebay.org.
* I did a food rescue run yesterday. There was a  lot of food redistributed to the people. I have been writing new songs that are sounding powerful. I have had over a dozen talks with people talking about the Train Of Thought. I'll be filling in the open access economy index with New Zealand's connections.
