	<br>
	<br>Mark Enoch: I sent a Resource Gift Economy (christmas) meme to

	<br>Perry from Copiosis:
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Copiosis we are completing final stages
	of an implementation strategy we&#x27;ll be launching in January. This
	includes a copiosis.com website design, a new outreach strategy on
	Twitter and Facebook, and preparations for a real world test of
	algorithm version 7.1. I&#x27;ve put a link to v7.1 documentation in
	the links section. 2019 strategy includes funnel marketing, leads
	marketing, PR marketing wrt a couple announcements around taking the
	Copiosis algorithm live in the real world. Look for a facebook campaign
	asking people to send us data we can use to run real-world tests of our
	algorithm, which, if successful, will lead to announcing the Copiosis
	Algorithm as a kind of production benchmark, and recognition for people
	doing great things to move the world forward. More next month.

	<br>=====================================================================================================
	<br>
	<br>We are creating the Gift Economy wherever we live now by each
	of us implementing ourselves the DIY Transition Plan:
	<br>1.Raise awareness about Gift Economy solutions, movements,
	films, books, authors, ideas, logos, projects, etc., everywhere,
	everyday. (examples and content here
	<a
		href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;docs&#x2e;google&#x2e;com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1F2q2FMreLo7Lp&#x5f;usXBW7AsEbicnBvYp7OJ00wBSo5Ek&#x29;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1F2q2FMreLo7Lp_usXBW7AsEbicnBvYp7OJ00wBSo5Ek)</a>
	<br>2.Expand Free Collaboration Networks that provide resources
	for free by joining them, using them, teaching them, organizing them
	and talking about them. (Examples here
	<a
		href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;docs&#x2e;google&#x2e;com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1vilnZIJsKZTAxEOm&#x2d;zyVBT7NeVlFbmomZXezHtQsZi4&#x29;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1vilnZIJsKZTAxEOm-zyVBT7NeVlFbmomZXezHtQsZi4)</a>
	<br>3. Inspire others to do the same by posting online about our
	work on 1 and 2 with the hashtags: #advertiseGiftEconomy , #expandFCNs
	, or #DIYtransition #advertiseTZM #advertiseTVP #advertiseRBE
	#advertiseFCNs #advertiseUbuntu #advertisetheFreeWorld
