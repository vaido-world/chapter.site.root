Once a week check the news-and-development channel and our personal messages in discord\n    3.

Notes of the meetings will be co-created by all attendees by filling out the following  template https://etherpad.net/p/TZM_meeting_template\n   5. At the end of each meeting the etherpad for the following meeting must be prepared from the template. Then both the etherpad notes of the concluded meeting and the etherpad for the following meeting must be immediately posted in the news-and-development thread. From that moment on people who wish to add a topic to the agenda can do so, with their name, in the coming meetings etherpad, in order. Once the meeting starts, whether at 9:00 or 21:00 UTC no items should be added to the agenda. If you want to add an item, add it at least 5 minutes before hand. If someone isn't there to discuss their item, that item can be skipped. \nPlease share this information with everyone who is or isn't part of the movement and invite them to come.

This is an international gathering of members of the Zeitgeist Movement (TZM) or guests that are interested in TZM and that are located somewhere in Europe. The first European Meet-Up was held in Rotterdam, Netherlands in December of 2015. The second European Meet-Up took place in Kiev, Ukraine in July of 2017. Now, our third European Meet-Up is going to be held in Scandinavia, west of Stockholm and once again in the summertime, so that all of our guests may enjoy the beautiful weather and exceptionally long days that Sweden enjoys in the summer.\n\nIf you have any other questions, please send us an email, write us on Facebook or other social media platforms.\n\nTZM Sweden’s email: info@thezeitgeistmovement.se\n\nWhat happens during this event? This differs from, and is more comprehensive and personal than, other typical TZM events. Instead of only being overwhelmed by a bunch of presentations with lots of factual information, we are presenting a vacation-like event for people to have fun, socialize at, and enjoy. Keep in mind, as well, that this is going to be a very productive and idea-rich event, with many new insights regarding projects and developments happening within TZM. Numerous other like-minded people and organizations will also be attending this event.\n\nRead more here: https://www.facebook.com/events/285168392092346/\n",

Much was accomplished as well as the main item of the agenda discussed: \n\n1) Project picture support (Mark Enoch)\n      Sugestions\n      + In movement sign language H R\n+ sign language C\n+ two handed Z sign or dove sign\n+ BSL for Z two handed\n\nThe idea is that with a hand gesture we can show support for the Resource Gift Economy in public, on stage, in pictures, from a distance, in videos and when people respond with the same sign we know we have company and support. We agree to try out these different hand signs and gestures and see which one naturally catches on and spreads. \nWe agree to try these out on stage and to wave to friends, to other TZMers, on pictures, ask people to do the sign and take a picture of them etc.  The idea of sharing pictures on social media of people doing these signs is for them to catch on faster and be known by the RBE Gifters and the general public. \n\nNotes of the meeting: https://board.net/p/TZM_Global_Discord_Sat_26_January_2019\n",

The default notification setting will be changed to \"mentions only\". That will prevent people getting notfications from all the messages from all the channels.\n5. Messages on lobby will changed to shorter ones (links to rules) \n6. #lobby will be the channel where you opt-in to use \"self-assigned roles\" (SAR).  If you choose a \"SAR-enable\" -role, you will see only a few channels at first. After that you choose what you want to see. You can test it on <#584825231168765980> right now if you want to.\n7. and finally SAR will be changed to be the default mode for everyone.\n",

We will create small communities called units where we build and research open source methods of producing resources to create free time for people to gather resources needed to launch a new \"unit\". So every unit creates new units and growth is exponential. Here is a more in detail description https://kotocoop.org/description/\n\nCheck out #koto channel  for links to project groups on Telegram or contact me and I'll add you,\n \nThere is also a group for people who are interested in similar things but not of Koto as an organization. We should still work together. \"Creating hi-tech NL/RBE communities\" . Link to that is also on #koto channel.\n",

    "text": "Last night @Juuso V (Finland) , @Woody , and myself were a part of meeting in regards to state of this Discord sever. We see that recently some issues have arose here in the server that should not have to linger here. Also some principles about TZM's train of thought and this server that should seem obvious and self explanatory seem to become a bit forgotten here.\n\nFirstly let me just say, that TZM is for everybody. From the most scientific, to the most religious; from the most left wing, to the most right wing; from the most dedicated, to the most lazy. This is a movement of all people of all kind. Now considering that, there is however a set of guidelines in TZM on how this movement operates and what kind of conduct of communication are expected in its bounds. Many have been recently ignored.\n\nEverybody in the movement and on this server are coming from somewhere differently, if that is from age, country, gender, history, and any other characteristics. We on this server do not diss or \"shit\" on others because they do not fit our expectations as a person, or do not see or accept exactly our views. This TZM server welcomes discussion and debate, but there is a manner in how one engages in them. Using profanity personally to someone's name personally or demonizing them (trolling) is a good as an act of violence and this community will note tolerate that. People have recently private messaged the admins or the moderators of the server to express that they no longer feel welcomed or comfortable on the server. This is a problem and this shit must stop.\n\nIf anybody has read the whole book of TZM defined, people should understand the principles of community and how to apply the scientific method as explained in the book. Dogmatism and alienating people were NEVER mentioned or encouraged in the book.\n",

Is the progression of technology going to be the answer for a better civilization, or is it going to require much more than that? What does our current global financial situation and changes in the environment mean for Iceland and the rest of the world? What visions and changes do you want to see now and in the future?\n\nThese are only some of the questions that will be addressed by many speakers from Iceland and around the world. On the 26th of September, we would like to welcome you to presentations from these speakers, your participation in Q&As and open discussions to be a part of the program, in order to share with everybody what you think matters.\nA beginning of a new decade has started with a lot of concerns and worries from the previous ones, along with the dreams, predictions, and hopes people wish to see fulfilled in this decade and beyond. In what future do you want to live in?\n\nThe event will be hosted in the Harpa Concert Hall, which is a state of the art architecturally designed building that features a distinctive colored glass facade inspired by the basalt landscape of Iceland. The building itself is a huge attraction in Reykjavík for tourists and even native Icelanders.\n\nMore info: https://www.facebook.com/events/569630620225604/\n",

This is due to the complications and setbacks the COVID19 pandemic has caused for this year's planing. The extra time needed is to further prepare a successful event as well as waiting for the situation to settle down a bit more, hopefully.\nOther important information is for those interested coming to Iceland. As of 24/08/2020, there are new border restrictions that all wishing to come to Iceland need to be aware of. These restrictions include mandatory screening for COVID19, then choosing a quarantine outfitted guesthouse or hotel for 5 days before being tested again for COVID19.\nInstructions for travels from The Chief Epidemiologist Of Iceland are here in English: \nhttps://www.landlaeknir.is/servlet/file/store93/item42645/Instructions%20for%20travellers%20in%20quarantine%2015.08.2020.pdf\n",

    "text": "It is also important to note that the 2 meter rule is now in effect in Iceland, which means as well that as of 24/08/2020, events or gatherings are not allowed to be any larger than 100 people and must respect the 2 meter rule. This means that the Zeitgeist-Day event will only have capacity of 100 participants as of now. Of course, this can change by November and we can allow more to the event depending on the restrictions.\nDue to this as well, this extra time we now have is going to be used to figure out the rest of the program after the presentations and also a pre-arrival dinner and afterparty.\nThis week we will start announcing speakers of the event and others within the program. Ticket sales will also be showing up shortly and they will also be mandatory for the event for we need to have assigned seating and be checking the limit of participants due to restrictions.\nWe have already received messages and emails from those interested in coming over. Depending on where you are coming from, there are probably very limited routes to come to Iceland at this time, but definitely possible. We ask you to email or message us on Facebook if you have any additional questions or need help in finding a route to Iceland from your location.\nKeep on the lookout for more updates and the release of ticket sales! 🙂\n",

    "text": "I am seeking six more authors to help me publish the next and ongoing bi-monthly issues of Latent Axiom.\n \nLatent Axiom is a digital magazine published in Flipbook format via Social Rebirth. The first issue, focused on the climate crisis, was completed and released in July 2019 by a team of six authors. With no advertising from cover to cover the project is purely funded through donations. The inaugural issue contained two feature articles, four long-form articles and twelve short-form articles spread across fifty-eight pages. Article references are all provided, enabling our audience to easily analyse our performance. This initial issue has set the minimum standard for Latent Axiom going forward, which I will constantly strive to improve upon.\n\n\nWith mainstream media outlets heavily reliant on income from business advertising dollars it is vital to have an independent option which is funded through donations alone. This allows authors to avoid the need to write clickbait or watered-down subject matter in order to acquiesce to big business and maintain corporate funding. The decision to offer a digital issue alone is based both on environmental concerns and economics. Not putting the magazine to print not only helps to reduce costs, but also greatly reduces the environmental footprint.\n\n\nThe underlying intent of Latent Axiom is to play a role in helping to transform contemporary civil discourse, encouraging profound reflection with respect to the orientation of our global culture.\n \nAuthors should have a strong understanding of the english language, have a robust understanding of TZM and write from a Zeitgeist perspective without mentioning Zeitgeist or The Venus Project.\n \nA free copy of the first issue of Latent Axiom is available for you to read here (https://socialrebirth.org/latent-axiom-magazine/). If you are interested in this project please do not hesitate to contact me directly. \n \nThank you for your time.\n",

    "text": "#TZMUkraine!\nFounding activist/coordinator for TZM Ukraine, @Oleksii Siryi , has recently opened a new Vegan Cheese business to demonstrate sustainable food production and possibilities for making plant-based cheeses. Profits will go back into the TZM Ukrain group to help further awareness. Barring Covid19 complications, Grey Vegan Cheese will be available at День Вегана (Vegan Day), Kiev's largest vegan festival on May 1st of 2021. https://www.facebook.com/GreyVeganCheese/\nAnd as early as 2017, prominent TZM activists have been working on plans to open up a cafe in the city of Kiev, as a hub for activism, organizing and com#munity. But due to Covid19 shutdowns all businesses of 'hospitality' stand a risk of going out of business, and so plans to open the cafe have been postponed.\nFacebook post: https://www.facebook.com/tzmglobal/posts/3358901760859122\n",

    "text": "Koto Coop Introduction video has been now published!\n\nThe idea of Koto Coop started a couple of years ago in Finland and is a grassroots initiative for a sustainable future where we share our resources, meaning both our materials and our time. With the goal of the well being of our human species being united and in cohabitation with our environment. Instead of the competitive, profit seeking incentive for infinite economic growth, to the detriment of both our individual and our collective health alike. With this in mind the purpose of Koto Coop is to develop and implement sustainable technologies and social structures that focus on making this vision a reality.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_UBsWDjYaw\n\nhttps://kotocoop.org\n\nPlease consider supporting our efforts:\nhttps://kotocoop.org/support/\n",
