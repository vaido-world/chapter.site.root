### Mark advertise a shared world

@â€‹everyone  Here are the minutes to this month's global assemblies. Please read the progress reports and feel free to add your personal report. Please share these minutes with others and invite them to the next global assemblies. They are always on the last Wednesday of the month at 21 UTC and the last Saturday of the month at 9UTC. They are the pulse of the movement, how we inspire each other and help each other on the transition.

Keep prosocializing, promoting and expanding a shared world and soon we will enjoy universal sustainable prosperity!
