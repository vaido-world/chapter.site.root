### LatentAxiom

Good day all.  
  
I am working on a digital magazine titled Latent Axiom. Issue one has been completed and issue two is underway. It is Zeitgeist themed, seeking to educate with respect to the root cause of the many symptoms prevalent in society.  
  
The first issue covered climate change and the second issue, currently being written, is focused on agriculture.  
  
The magazine is published in UK English in a digital flipbook format. If you enjoy writing and have a good understanding of the English language, would like to help, or have questions about the project please do not hesitate to contact me directly via Discord.  
  
Thank you for your time, interest and support.
