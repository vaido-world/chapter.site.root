Perhaps of interest is that we had some prankish trolling during today's meeting that was livecast during the meeting. The Youtube video for that can be found here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpZoDrqXi0k  
Being teased a little may help us maintain perspective and a sense of humor and help us remember to not take ourselves too seriously. üòÉ
