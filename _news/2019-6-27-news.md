Another constructive global progress meeting was held yesterday on Team Speak, just as every last Wednesday of the month. If you couldn't attend please read the minutes to see all the work we have been doing, here https://board.net/p/TZM_Global_TeamSpeak_Wednesday_26_June_2019  
  
We are growing as a movement and our ideas are spreading. If we keep doing what we are doing we will make it! Keep spreading the word!  Happy Gift Society.
