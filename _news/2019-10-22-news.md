### Teun

Hi, I made a compilation of the 3 Zeitgeist movies (compressed 6,5 hours into 1 hour) and put Dutch subtitles in it, so it will be easier for me to explain to my friends and family in the Netherlands what's going on. https://www.bitchute.com/video/kr9hEIC5Sy3R/  
I'm also planning to go to Brussels next month: https://craphound.com/news/2019/10/18/crowdfunding-a-symposium-on-a-green-postcapitalist-economics-in-brussels-nov-11/
