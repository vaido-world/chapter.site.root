@â€‹everyone  Here are the minutes (notes) of August's global progress meetings, they include our progress reports. Much is getting done in a handful of different areas in the world. Read them to get inspired to be more active.   
Collective decisions taken:  
We are in the process of establishing a partnership with Extinction Rebellion.  
We are working on combining the minutes of both monthly progress meetings.
