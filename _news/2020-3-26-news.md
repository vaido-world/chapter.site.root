TZM Riot instance is now available. It is a chat platform similar to slack, mattermost and discord. Currently there is two channels that are connected to TZM Discord server: #general and #off-topic  
  
https://chat.tzm.community/#/group/+tzm:matrix.tzm.community  
  
Riot app on mobile also works really well. If you create an account through TZM riot, you should change the "login server" to https://matrix.tzm.community  
  
Instructions will be published here: https://tzm.community/chat
