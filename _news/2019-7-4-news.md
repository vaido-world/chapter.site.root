### jeukku (Juuso V)

The European meeting in Sweden is going great. There have been organized discussions on topics work, agriculture, education and culture/religion in RBE, what changes in me in RBE and even a peaceful discussion about veganism.  
Lots of hanging out together indoors and outdoors. So far it has been amazing ðŸ˜ƒ. More people are coming for the weekend.
