### Z O Tha Lone Wolf

@â€‹everyone The monthly global Saturday online assembly is this week, 30.05.2020. 9UTC on TZM Discord server in the (voice) international channel. The Wednesday global monthly assembly will be this week (27.05.2020. 21UTC) and it will be held on TZM Discord server in the (voice) international channel. (https://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/about/#model)  
  
The reason we chose to move the mumble server from previous months to Discord is because it seems to be more convenient for people. We will check in on the mumble server and direct people to where it's appropriate to be at the time.   
  
Please share progress reports on these notes even if you cannot join either meetings. We certainly would like to hear about it even if your action is to just talk more to people about the ideas, albeit online these days, considering.  If you are joining, add anything to the agenda you wish to be talked in either meetings along with your name https://board.net/p/TZM_Global_May_2020  
  
Be great to hear from you all. Hope to see you soon. Thank you all.
