This is where you can share your progress and ask for help with your project. In this link are the minutes: https://board.net/p/TZM_Global_Wednesday9_September_2020  
In the "progress report" section  is where you should write down your progress raising awareness or in your project.   
If there is something you wish to discuss or a project you wish to recruit people for, write it down in the "agenda" along with your name.   
Before then please consult the last assembly's minutes and do your best to complete the tasks before this coming assembly: https://board.net/p/TZM_Global_August_2020.html
