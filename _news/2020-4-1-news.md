### Mark advertise a shared world

@â€‹everyone As always, we had very productive global assemblies in the end of March. Please read the minutes. In them are included the progress reports and minutes of the Castilian global assembly.   
https://board.net/p/r.3f2997a35c57a0369832c2e6e9c81e5a  
  
Please remember that it is paramount for everybody to invite others to the assemblies and remind them to come.   
  
It also would be very useful for non-global meetings to write progress reports and add them to the global assemblies progress reports. If needed, ask admins how to do so.  
  
Together we are creating a shared world!
