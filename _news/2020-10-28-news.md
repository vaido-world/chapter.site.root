### Z O Tha Lone Wolf

@â€‹everyone   
Call to meeting:  
This coming Saturday 31st at 9UTC here in discord we will hold the Open Access Assembly in the (voice) International and #int-voice-chat !  https://discord.gg/TtswKsh  
This is where you can share your progress and ask for help with your project. This is the link to the pad where we will write the minutes:   
https://yopad.eu/p/TZM_Global_Saturday31_October_2020  
In the "progress report" section  is where you should write down your progress raising awareness or in your project. If you can, do so before the meeting.  
If there is something you wish to discuss or a project you wish to recruit people for, write it down in the "agenda" along with your name.   
  
You are all really important and we can't wait to talk to you and connect up.  
  
If you would like to help co-host an assembly, be my guest family. Here are the guide lines.

Together we have the collective ability to cause long lasting positive systemic effects.   
  
Will see you Saturday.   
Love you all.
