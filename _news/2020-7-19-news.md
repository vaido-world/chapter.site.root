### Mark advertise a shared world

@â€‹everyone This month's Open Access Assemblies will be next Saturday 25.07.2020 at 9h UTC  and the Wednesday 29.07.2020 following that at 21h UTC. Both will be held on TZM Discord server in the (voice) international channel.  
Here is the meeting's pad: https://board.net/p/TZM_Global_July_2020  
In the pad there is the agenda waiting for you to add items to it.  
We wish all of you reading this would come.  Add anything to the agenda that you wish to be talked in either assembly along with your name.   
If you want to know how Open Access Assemblies are held read: https://board.net/p/How_to_hold_TZM_and_NHRM_meetings  
The best part is we all get to know what everyone else has been doing and we get to ask everyone else for help on our own initiative.   
As a global team, nothing can stop us!
