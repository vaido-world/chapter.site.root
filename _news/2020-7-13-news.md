@â€‹everyone   
  
I would like to announce that Global Zeitgeist-Day for 2020 is going to be now held on the 28th of Novemeber, due to complications from the COVID19 pandemic. Though, this could be nothing more than a blessing, since actually this is helping expand the program and bring more attention to te event in Iceland. Stay tuned for news about performers/speakers, as well as ticket sales. More updates to come shortly.  
Z-Day 2020..... From 2009 to now, this event has come a long way, literally. Who would have thought? ðŸ™‚

I'm looking at putting together a TZM newsletter. We'll obviously be including the Zday 2020 announcement.  
But if you've got something you'd like to add then contact me ( Discord, Telegram, FB, whatever ).
