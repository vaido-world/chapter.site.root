### Mark advertise the RBE

This Saturday monthly meeting went great with 11 attendees, including the return of experienced catalysts that had been absent for years!  
You can read the progress we all have been making in the minutes pad as well as some exclusive NHRM songs yet to be released! https://board.net/p/TZM_Global_Discord_Sat_25_May_2019  


### Mark advertise the RBE

-------------------------------------  
Todays second global monthly meeting in Spanish also went well.   
We plan to hold regular weekly meetings to talk RBE (Gift Society) every Sunday at 12 UTC in "(voice) espa√±ol" under "CONTINENTAL". We also talked about Universal Basic Access and the importance of implementing Gift Society values in our lives with social and technological innovation like FCNs and Open Source Ecology.
