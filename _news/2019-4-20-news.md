### Michael Kubler

We've now created the #tzm_website  and #tzm_survey_team  channels for those interested in discussing those projects more. They are at the bottom of the Projects and Technologies channel list in Discord.

There's proposal docs for both. 

We need a designer and people to help write and review content for the website.

Plus people with an interest in psychometric profiling, things like Spiral Dynamics (SDi) and proper polling techniques for the survey team. 

Hopefully we can make some progress towards some great projects ðŸ˜ƒ
