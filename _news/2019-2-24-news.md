### Mark advertise the RBE

We had a relaxed yet interesting monthly meeting Saturday! We discussed how to easily clip documentaries in to bit-sized bits easy seeds to sow, games being designed that are inline with our train of thought, a talk being prepared for London's Zday and all the work being done by Michael in Czech Republic? 
Here are the notes.

Steadily we are changing the world!


### Mark advertise the RBE

@â€‹everyone who wasn't able to make it to the Saturday meeting please come to the coming Wednesday meeting to share progress and move forward. Meeting is how we motivate each other to get and keep active. 
Add items you wish to discuss to the agenda before and hand and also add your progress reports in the notes:

Remember that the more people we invite and remind to come the more people will come. It's everyone's responsibility to nag others simply because we all are busy and need to be nagged a bit to do anything. 
Slowly but steadily we are liberating humanity!
